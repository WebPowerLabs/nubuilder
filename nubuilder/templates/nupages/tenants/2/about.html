                        I have done business with Jackson Tile for many years! They have been professional and helpful when I had questions regarding colors that would go with the décor I was using. I would recommend them to anyone and have many times.

                        We’ve engaged Jackson Tile for our floors, tub/shower and fireplace in our new home. Jen and Bart led us through the tile selection process and helped keep us on track not only with our selections but with costs. Shortly after the floors were completed, the house was threatened by flooding during monsoon season. We were unable to get to the house due to the road conditions but Jen and Bart went to the house with mops, fans and the whole family to deal with whatever came. This is commitment beyond expectations on which you cannot put a price and demonstrates the type of excellence you can expect from Jackson Tile.

                        Our new tile floors look great and we just wanted to express our satisfaction to you. We had several quotes for the job and you guys were more than competitive but more importantly the quality of work and attention to detail was much appreciated. We’ve had a number of people compliment how great our floors look and I’ve recommended Jackson Tile to several people already.

                        We hired Jackson Tile to tile our entire house. We were not there when the work was done but they kept us updated daily with pictures and email. They had to remove carpet, tile, linoleum and replace some baseboard molding. When we got back, everything was cleaned up and the house looked brand new. Bart and Jennifer worked together to get the job done beautifully. They are a great team!

                        Jackson Tile designed the tile work for our living area and master bedroom. Because the new tile would have needed to be placed next to some original tile work that came with the house, Jennifer and Bart designed a transition area that is just beautiful. It has various sizes, type and texture pieces. Also, the tile in the living area has copper inlayed squares randomly placed in the center of 4 tiles. We also had them replace the original tile in our master bath. We were very pleased with their work. They were professional - arriving at the house when they said they would, answered and returned our calls during the processes and completed the work on time. I would hire them again.
